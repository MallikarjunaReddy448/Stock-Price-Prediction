# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price prediction is related to time series analysis.
So, I have used 30% of the data for testing pupose by finding the 30% of the data from total data available.
As in time series analysis we are not allowed to split the train and test data by random state cause it leads to change in order and history of the date and time.
As we know that this is Regression problem cause our target varible is Continuous data.
I have used LinearRegression, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Ridge Regressor.
Both Linear Regression and Ridge Regressor performed well.
