# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price prediction is related to time series analysis.
So, I have used 30% of the data for testing pupose by finding the 30% of the data from total data available.
As in time series analysis we are not allowed to split the train and test data by random state cause it leads to change in the date and time that was actually happened data in real time.
As we know that this is Regression problem cause our target varible is Continuous data.
I have used Logistic Regression, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Ridge Regressor.
